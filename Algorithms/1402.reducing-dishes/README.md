# [1402. Reducing Dishes](https://leetcode.com/problems/reducing-dishes/)

A chef has collected data on the `satisfaction` level of his `n` dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

**Like-time coefficient** of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. `time[i] * satisfaction[i]`.

Return _the maximum sum of **like-time coefficient** that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation_.

Dishes can be prepared in **any** order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]
Output: 14
Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14).
Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]
Output: 20
Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]
Output: 0
Explanation: People do not like the dishes. No dish is prepared.
```

## Solutions
### [Greedy](ReducingDishes.java)

Idea: We use greedy to sort all satisfaction and then if the current dish plus previous dishesâ€™ satisfaction is greater than 0, then we can choose this dish. Otherwise, we can break the loop directly.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSatisfaction(int[] satisfaction) {
        Arrays.sort(satisfaction);
        int preSum = 0, res = 0;
        for (int i = satisfaction.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (preSum + satisfaction[i] > 0) {
                preSum += satisfaction[i];
                res += preSum;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n)$. The time complexity of Sort in java is $O(n\log n)$.
- Space Complexity: $O(\log n)$. The space complexity of sort is $O(\log n)$.
