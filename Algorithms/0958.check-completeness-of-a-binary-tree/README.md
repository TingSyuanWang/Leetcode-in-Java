# [958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a _complete binary tree_.

In a **[complete binary tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2<sup>h</sup>` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
```

## Solutions
### BFS

Idea: We define a new class called `ANode` and give every node in the tree a number. If the last number is not correspond with node size number, it means itâ€™s not a complete tree.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isCompleteTree(TreeNode root) {
        List<ANode> nodes = new ArrayList<>();
        nodes.add(new ANode(root, 1));
        int i = 0;
        while (i < nodes.size()) {
            ANode anode = nodes.get(i++);
            if (anode.node != null) {
                nodes.add(new ANode(anode.node.left, anode.code * 2));
                nodes.add(new ANode(anode.node.right, anode.code * 2 + 1));
            }
        }

        return nodes.get(i - 1).code == nodes.size();
    }
}

class ANode {
    TreeNode node;
    int code;

    ANode(TreeNode node, int code) {
        this.node = node;
        this.code = code;
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. $n$ is the amount of nodes in the tree.
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
